### **About the data :**

A csv file containing monthly profit and loss for over seven years, budget_data.csv is provided for analysis.  There are only two columns - date in year and month format and the corresponding profit and loss amount.  

The election_data.csv stores the voter ID, county the voter is from and which candidate the voter selected.  How many votes for each candidate ? Who is the winner ? We need the answer. 



### **About the python scripts**

A python script processes budget_data.csv and computes the net profit and loss figure, how many months of data there are, the average of change in profit and loss amount, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses.  

For the election results, a python program counts the number of votes for each candidate, computes the percentage and declares the winner.

The python scripts use :

- functions,
- csv file processing - read/write,
- for loop, 
- array processing - append, zip, 
- math operations - sum/rounding/division/multiplication/subtraction, 
- convert data types,
- and sorting.



### Deployment

The python scripts, main.py can be run :



python main.py
